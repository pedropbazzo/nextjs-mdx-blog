For this, nothing better than using the definition of who created it, Facebook itself, which defines it like this:\nA declarative, efficient and flexible JavaScript library for creating visual interfaces\nWith that, we have to:\nReact is not a framework, but a library.\nReact is used to create visual interfaces (UI).\nThese two pieces of information together create the first big confusion for those just starting out: if React is just a library and only serves to create UI, how can I create complete applications with it?\nAnd to resolve this issue we need to understand that when the community refers to React, what it really means is React and its ecosystem.\nAnd this ecosystem is formed by:\nReact\nJSX\nES2015\nWebpack\nFlux / Redux\naxios / fetch\nJest / Mocha\nAnd with all these items, which are part of the React ecosystem, we can say that it is possible to create complete applications using React.\nJSX\nExplaining quickly, JSX is an extension of JavaScript syntax (hence the name, JavaScript Syntax eXtension) that allows us to write HTML within JavaScript.\nIn the early days, JSX was a major reason for criticism and jokes about React. In theory we were back in time when mixing HTML with JavaScript.\nThe staunchest critics claimed that JSX breaks one of the basic principles of software development, which is the Separation of Concerns.\nIn my opinion, this view is wrong for two reasons:`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Lighthouse:`}</strong>{` If you want first-hand evidence of the audit scores shown in the project README.md, feel free to run a Lighthouse audit of this site. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Scores are more accurate when run in an incognito browser because Chrome extensions can adversely affect scores.`}</em></p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AACA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AANA;AACA;AAOA;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAHA;AACA;AAIA;AACA;AADA;AAGA;AACA;AAGA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AADA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAGA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAuBA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAEA;AACA;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
